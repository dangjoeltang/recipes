# Stir-fried chicken gizzard

## Ingredients

This dish can be made with a lot of different peppers/veggies. I usually use scallions and jalapenos, and add serranos if I want it spicier üå∂Ô∏è

#### Main ingredients

- 1 lb chicken gizzard (wash & clean)
- 2 Jalapeno peppers (sliced into coins or whatever shape you prefer)
- 1 thumb of ginger (sliced into coins)(peeled or skin-on doesn't really matter. Just wash it.) ü´ö
- 3+ Garlic cloves (slightly smashed) üßÑ
- 2-3 Scallions (whites cut into 1/2" segments, greens 2") (prefer thicker scallions with larger white sections)
- 1 Leek (optional, and can use this instead of scallions)
- 1-2 Serrano peppers (optional)

#### Secondaries

- 3 Tbsp Light soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp Dark soy sauce
- 3 Tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (can use sake or similar)
- Roasted sesame oil
- Corn starch slurry (2 Tbsp corn starch, 1/2 cup of water)
- Salt üßÇ
- 1 tsp Sugar (optional, but I find it balances the spicy)
- Black pepper (fresh cracked is best)
- 1/4 cup of chicken or mushroom or veggie stock (optional)
- 1/2 tsp Baking soda (optional to make the gizzards more tender)
- MSG üí• (optional)
- Sesame seeds (garnish)

## Steps

### Prep the gizzards

1. Wash the gizzards and remove excess fat
2. Start boiling a pot of water to blanch the gizzards with. Add 1 Tbsp Shaoxing, 1 Tbsp salt, and a couple slices of ginger
3. Slice into whatever sized pieces you prefer
   - Generally larger pieces will be tougher, so I suggest soaking the gizzards in water with 1/2 tsp of baking soda for about 15-20 minutes before cooking.
4. Parboil the sliced gizzards and wait for the water to come back up to a boil. (Drain and rinse first if soaking with baking soda)
   - Reserve a bit of the liquid if you don't have any stock.
   - You want to cook the gizzard about 80% of the way
   - I usually boil it for ~10 minutes, but I've also forgotten and left it for 30 minutes before
5. In a mixing bowl, combine the blanched gizzard with the salt, sugar, black pepper, MSG, light & dark soy sauce. Set aside

### Stir fry

I reccommend using a stainless, carbon steel, or cast iron pan on high heat for the best browning

1. Bring pan up to temp on med heat.
2. Add 2 Tbsp cooking oil, swirl to coat the pan
3. Add the garlic, and remaining ginger slices. Cook until theyre both slightly browned and smelling nice
4. Add scallion whites (or leek), and jalapeno/serrano peppers and cook until everything is browned nicely.
5. Deglaze with shaoxing wine. Reduce if there is too much liquid in the pan

At this point we will throw in the marinated gizzards. I found that when I didn't parboil them it was hard to season to my liking. Also the timing of everything in the mix was harder.

6. Turn the heat up to high and add the marinated gizzards. Ideally this is done with a high powered gas burner like my outdoor propane burner.
7. Toss and combine everything, season to taste if needed
8. Add the 1/4 cup reserved liquid or stock
   - If there is too much liquid, just keep reducing it until there's about 1/4 cup remaining. (not an exact science ‚Äì can usually make up for it with more/thicker corn starch slurry)
9. Make sure the liquid in the pan is boiling/bubbling, and then slowly pour in half of the corn starch slurry and mix. Check the consistency and use the rest of slurry if desired.
   - I like to get the consistency to be thick enough that it clings to the gizzards
10. Add 1 tsp roasted sesame oil and the scallion greens. Mix until the scallion greens are wilted.
11. Last chance to season with salt/sugar
12. Plate up, garnish with sesame seeds
